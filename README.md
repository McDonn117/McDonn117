- 👋 Hi, I’m @McDonn117
- 👀 I’m interested in (almost)everything coding: Front-end Web Development, Mobile App Development and Machine Learning. But I mostly just play PC and Mobile games, Netflix, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Firebase.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with someone at Chingu.io and I am preparing myself for the workshop.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can message me here on Github and I'll send you more details.
