- 👋 Hi, I’m @McDonn117
- 👀 I’m interested in (almost) everything coding: Web Development, Mobile App Development and Machine Learning. But aside from work and study, I mostly just play PC and Mobile games, Netflix, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Next JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who will help me with my learning journey and become a full-time front-end developer at a good company.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can message me here on Github and I'll send you more details.
